# The Taelgar Player Map

This is a interactive map of the fantasy world of Taelgar, the collaborative world built by me and some friends as a setting for our D&D games.

## To Do

- Add pins with images to selected locations
- Add a coordinate system to allow updating base map without changing pins
- Add a tool to measure distance
- Add a separate layer for text 

## Acknowledgements
